Android NDK ChangeLog:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
current version

IMPORTANT BUG FIXES:

- Fix build/host-setup.sh to execute as a Bourne shell script (again)

- Make target shared libraries portable to systems that don't use the exact same
  toolchain (GCC 4.2.1) .

- Actually use the awk version detected by host-setup.sh during the build.


IMPORTANT CHANGES:

- Added platform eclair-5 to reflect the Eclair branch. This is merely a copy
  of android-4 that also includes headers and libraries for OpenGL ES 2.0.

  See the sample named "hello-gl2" for a *very* basic demonstration. Note that
  OpenGL ES 2.0 is currently *not* available from Java, and must be used through
  native code exclusively.


OTHER FIXES & CHANGES:

- Added --prebuilt-ndk=FILE option to build/tools/make-release.sh script to
  package a new experimental NDK package archive from the current source tree
  plus the toolchain binaries of an existing NDK release package. E.g.:

    build/tools/make-release.sh \
       --prebuilt-ndk=/path/to/android-ndk-1.6_r1-linux-x86.zip

  will generate a new NDK package in /tmp/ndk-release that contains the most
  up-to-date build scripts, plus the toolchain binaries from 1.6_r1 (which
  are not in the git repository).

  Also added the --no-git option to collect all sources from the current
  NDK root directory, instead of the list given by 'git ls-files'. This can
  be useful if you don't want to checkout the whole 'platform/development'
  project from repo and still work on the NDK.

  This change is to help people easily package experimental NDK releases to
  test and distribute fixes and improvements.

- Remove bash-isms from build/tools/build-toolchain.sh. Now it's possible to
  build it with the 'dash' shell on Debian-based systems (tested on Ubuntu 8.04)

- Remove bash-ism from build/tools/build-ndk-sysroot.sh

- Refresh C library headers for all platforms:

    - make <endian.h> simply include <sys/endian.h>
    - make <stdint.h> properly declare 64-bit integer types with a C99 compiler
    - add missing <sys/types.h> to <strings.h>
    - add GLibc-compatible macro aliases (st_atimensec, st_mtimensec and
      st_ctimensec) to <stat.h>
    - add missing declaration for tzset() in <time.h>

android-ndk-1.6_r1

IMPORTANT BUG FIXES:

- Fix build/host-setup.sh to:
  * execute as a Bourne shell script
  * remove unused host gcc dependency
  * improve Windows host auto-detection
  * add GNU Make version check
  * add Nawk/Gawk check
  * ensure that the script is run from $NDKROOT as build/host-setup.sh
  * add --help, --verbose, --no-awk-check and --no-make-check options

- Properly add sysroot library search path at build time. This makes a line
  in Android.mk like:

     LOCAL_LDLIBS := -lz

  Actually work correctly, instead of having the linker complaining that it
  could not find the corresponding libz.so library. Also clear LOCAL_LDLIBS
  in $(CLEAR_VARS) script.


IMPORTANT CHANGES:

- The 'sources' directory is gone. The NDK build system now looks for
  $(APP_PROJECT_PATH)/jni/Android.mk by default. You can override this with
  the new APP_BUILD_SCRIPT variable in Application.mk

  For example, the 'hello-jni' sample uses the following files:

    apps/hello-jni/project/jni/Android.mk
    apps/hello-jni/project/jni/hello-jni.c

  The 'apps/<name>' directory is still needed in this release though.

- Change LOCAL_CFLAGS / LOCAL_CPPFLAGS to work as in the full Android build
  system. This means that:

    - LOCAL_CFLAGS   is now used for *both* C and C++ sources  (was only for C)
    - LOCAL_CPPFLAGS is now used for C++ sources only (was for both C and C++)
    - LOCAL_CXXFLAGS is used like LOCAL_CPPFLAGS but is considered obsolete.
      (will disappear in next release)

  Also fixed APP_CPPFLAGS / APP_CFLAGS / APP_CXXFLAGS correspondingly.

- Rename build/platforms/android-1.5 to build/platforms/android-3 to match
  the Android API level instead of the marketing speak.

  Also add a new build/platforms/android-4, and make the build system select
  which platform to use based on the content of the project file named
  $(APP_PROJECT_PATH)/default.properties.

- Add OpenGL ES 1.x headers and libraries to the android-4 stable APIs.
  (NOTE: they are *not* available for android-3)

  Also provide a small port of the "San Angeles Observation" demo to show
  how to make a simple Android application that uses them.


OTHER FIXES & CHANGES

- Generate thumb binaries by default.

- Add support for LOCAL_ARM_MODE in Android.mk.

- Add support for the '.arm' suffix in source file names to force the
  compilation of a single source in arm (32-bit) mode.

- Generate proper unoptimized versions of binaries when APP_OPTIM := debug

- Add support for LOCAL_C_INCLUDES in Android.mk

- Fix compilation of assembler files (e.g. foo.S)
