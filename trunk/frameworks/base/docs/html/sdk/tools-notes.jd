<p>SDK Tools is a downloadable component for the Android SDK. It
includes the complete set of development and debugging tools for the Android
SDK.</p>

<p>This document provides version-specific information about SDK Tools
releases. To keep up-to-date on new releases, make sure that you view this page
at <a
href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/tools-notes.html">http://developer.
android.com/sdk/tools-notes.html</a>.</p>

<p>To install SDK Tools in your SDK environment (and replace the
existing tools), use the Android SDK and AVD Manager. For more information, see
<a href="{@docRoot}sdk/adding-components.html">Adding SDK Components</a>. </p>


<h2 id="3">SDK Tools, Revision 3</h2>

<p>SDK Tools 3 provides several new features for developers and includes
fixes for several tools issues, as described below. </p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

<p>SDK Tools 3 is compatible with ADT 0.9.4 and later, but not
compatible with earlier versions. If you are developing in Eclipse with ADT, you
<strong>must</strong> update your ADT plugin to version 0.9.4 or higher if you
install SDK Tools 3 in your SDK. </p>

<h3>Android tool</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adds new <code>android create test-project</code> and <code>android update
test-project</code> commands to allow for greater flexibility in the location of the
main and test projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DDMS</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adds a button to dump HPROF file for running appplications (app must be able
to write to the sdcard).</li>
<li>Button to start/stop profiling of a running application (app must be able to
write to the sdcard). Upon stop, Traceview will automatically be launched to
display the trace.</li>
<li>Fixed DDMS, Traceview, and the AVD Mananger/SDK Updater to run on Mac OS X
10.6.</li>
<li>Fixed screenshot support for devices running 32-bit framebuffer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Android SDK and AVD Manager</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provides a new UI that lets you set options for controlling
the emulator skin, screen size/density, and scale factor used when launching 
an AVD.</li>
<li>Provides improved AVD creation UI, which lets you customize the hardware
properties of your AVDs.</li>
<li>Now enforces dependencies between platforms and tools components, and
between SDK add-ons and platforms.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Layoutopt, a new tool for optimizing layouts</h3>

<p>The SDK Tools 3 package includes <code>layoutopt</code>, a new command-line 
tool that helps you optimize your layout hierarchies. When run against your 
layout files, the tool analyzes their hierarchies and notifies you of 
inefficiencies and other potential issues. The tool also provides simple 
solutions for the issues it finds. For usage, see <a 
href="{@docRoot}guide/developing/tools/layoutopt.html">layoutopt</a>.
